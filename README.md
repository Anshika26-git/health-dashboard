I've implemented everything in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript to make it easy to run.
For mobile responsiveness, I used Tailwind CSS classes and custom media queries.
For the React-like experience, I created component-style UI sections with state management using localStorage.
For accessibility:
Used icons alongside text
Proper form labeling
High contrast colors in both light/dark modes
Clear visual hierarchy
Features included:
Sign up / login forms with validation
File upload section with PDF preview placeholder
User dashboard with profile card
Upload history tracking
Dark/light mode toggle
Mobile-responsive design
Accessibility features (icons with text labels, proper contrast)
